# SWAPSKILL

SWAPSKILL — a simple skill-exchange web app for students.  
Users list skills they can **teach** and skills they want to **learn**, then get matched with complementary partners.

## Project status
- ✅ Landing page (index.html)
- 🟨 Starter UI and matching algorithm (to be added)
- 🟦 Next: convert to React, add authentication, database (Firestore or Supabase), and chat/video links.

## How to contribute (quick)
1. Open the repo in GitHub web editor (press `.` on the repo page) or create a Codespace.  
2. Edit files directly in the browser and commit changes.  
3. For larger features, create a branch and open a Pull Request.

## Ideas & roadmap
- Profiles (teach / learn), ratings, project showcase  
- Matching algorithm (complementary skills)  
- Live sessions via Jitsi / Zoom integration  
- Gamification: badges, leaderboards
